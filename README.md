# Unreal-Time-Series-Utility

One-line description: Unreal Engine utility class for managing and manipulating time-series data within game projects.

Summary: This Unreal Engine C++ utility includes a UCLASS `UTimeSeriesContainer`, which uses Unreal Engine's UPROPERTY and UFUNCTION macros to manage time-series data. The class stores pairs of timestamps and values in a TMap, providing functionality to add, retrieve, and clear data points. It supports Blueprints, allowing designers to interact with the data directly within the Unreal Editor. Functions include checking for existing timestamps, retrieving values at specific times, and returning all data points as an array. It is designed for use within Unreal projects that require tracking and analysis of time-dependent data.
